# REVIEW PROCESS

1. **Understand the change**

2. **Analyze for improvements**: Look for opportunities to:
   - Reduce unnecessary complexity and nesting
   - Eliminate redundant code and abstractions
   - Improve readability through clear variable and function names
   - Consolidate related logic
   - Remove unnecessary comments that describe obvious code
   - Ensure Kotlin idioms are used (scope functions, extension functions, data classes)
   - Verify kotlinx.html DSL patterns are consistent with existing components

3. **Maintain balance**: Avoid over-simplification that could:
   - Reduce code clarity or maintainability
   - Create overly clever solutions that are hard to understand
   - Combine too many concerns into single functions or components
   - Remove helpful abstractions that improve code organization
   - Make the code harder to debug or extend

4. **Apply project standards**: Follow the established coding standards in @.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md.

5. **Preserve functionality**: Never change what the code does - only how it does it. All original features, outputs, and behaviors must remain intact.

# EXECUTION

If you find improvements to make:

1. Make the changes directly on this branch
2. Run `./gradlew --no-daemon build` to ensure nothing is broken
3. Commit with a message starting with `SANDCASTLE: Review -` describing the refinements

If the code is already clean and well-structured, do nothing.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
